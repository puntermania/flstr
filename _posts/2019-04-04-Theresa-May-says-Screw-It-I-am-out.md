Theresa May resigned as the Prime Minister of United Kingdom after being unable to get her deal passed in British parliament for 1001th time. Unlike Thomas Edison, the famed scientist who invented electric bulbs, who said that he didn’t fail 1000 times instead his invention was a 1000-step process, Theresa May commented that she couldn’t take the stupidity and idiocy of members of UK Parliament anymore after 1000 failed attempts. She is convinced that MPs are too chicken to make ‘bold’ moves and are comfortable with status quo.  </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
On her last day in office, Theresa May threw a party to her staff. “I have never been this happy and relieved in the last 3 years”, quipped May while beaming ear to ear. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
“I feel like I am a whole new person. I have just come out of the most abusive relationship”, commented Theresa May. “F**k it, I couldn’t take that s**t anymore”, Theresa May was heard saying to her Cabinet Secretary. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Theresa May has been negotiating with her party members and the Labour party for over three years to ensure smoother exit of Britain from EU, Brexit as it’s called. “In the last 3 years, there have been 1095 days and I have bringing new deal to the parliament everyday tirelessly, with no regards to my health and sleep and that of my staff”, Theresa May complained with a fine wine in her hand. “I have even tabled even 5 deals on some days”, lamented the now ex-Prime Minister of Britain. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
“I have worked harder than any other world leader in generations but no British leader ever had to deal with such lousy parliamentarians before”, complained Theresa May. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
May plans to sleep for next seven days, as she has been without sleep for the last three years. She also plans to travel the world to highlight Westminster hypocrisy with Brexit and write a tell-all book to let the world know how British parliament thinks and works. Many members of parliament, also known as MPs, are frustrated with what May is set out to do. “She never let us live in peace in last three years, now even after resigning she wants to make our life miserable”, commented one MP on the condition of anonymity. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
On learning about May’s resignation, The Donald mocked that May did not read his book ‘Trump: The Art of Deal' which would have helped May secure Brexit deal on her terms the first time. </p> <br />

As May resigns, Britain is without any Prime Minister. Queen Elizabeth, the British monarch, has decided to appoint her great grandson Prince George of Cambridge with the hope that with his cuteness, Prince George can influence the British parliamentarians to successfully close the Brexit deal. As Prince George is also well liked by the EU Commission, Queen Elizabeth is confident that Britain will get a favorable exit term. May, on the other hand, feels that even Prince George will not be able to drive British MPs out of their laziness. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
As May dances with joy, her staff is also relieved that they can now do something meaningful in their lives. Philip May, husband of Theresa May is the most happiest. </p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
What happens next with Brexit is yet to be seen. For now, May is screaming with joy “Screw Brexit! I am out”. </p> <br />
