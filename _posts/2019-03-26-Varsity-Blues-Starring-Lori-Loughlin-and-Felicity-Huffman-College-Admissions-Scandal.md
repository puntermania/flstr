Varsity Blues was recently released in the spring of 2019 starring Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman and their families. Produced and Directed by FBI, this spring classic took 7 years in making. The movie marks debut of Rick, who is also the EP and screenwriter for the movie. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
It’s spring and we have our share of scandals already. Lori Loughlin, Full House and Fuller House actress, and Felicity Huffman, the determined Lynette from Desperate Housewives, are accused of committing crimes. Wait, what? How could these lovely ladies commit crimes? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald asks. Was it DUI? These hollywood types. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
It’s not DUI. It’s bigger than that. It’s getting their kids into top universities. Wait, what? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald asks. Since when forcing kids to top universities is a crime? Asians do it. Indians do it. Whites do it. Blacks do it. Hispanics do it. Men do it. Women do it. Gays do it. Lesbians do it. It’s the only thing we all humans have in common. Do everything to send our kids to top universities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
It’s not where you send your kids. It’s how you send your kids. It’s a yuuuuuge scandal The Donald. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Looks like Lori Loughlin paid bribes to get her daughters into top universities. Lori Loughlin paid $500,000 to get her daughters into USC. And, Felicity Huffman paid $15,000 to a person to pretend to be her daughter for SATs and get her daughter the coveted National Merit Scholarship. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald asks. What’s wrong with Lori? She paid $500,000 to get her daughters into USC. Couldn’t she aim an Ivy League at least? Are people that dumb to spend so much money for a bad product? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Now, now The Donald. Calm down. May be Lori ain’t no smart.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald says. You bet! Lori ain’t no smart. She doesn’t know how this is done. For millions of years, us moneyed folks have smartly ‘donated’ money to universities for buildings, labs and athletic centers to send our kids to top universities. I cannot imagine why Lori couldn’t do what has always been done before. No one gets caught that way. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald says. Do not get me started on Felicity. How stupid is her daughter that Felicity sent some other kid to write SATs for her daughter. Do SATs even matter? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald asks. Where are they now? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Both Lori and Felicity were arrested and released on bail. The case is ongoing and they could see jail terms. </p> 

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Donald says. Serves them right for being this stupid. I have never seen anyone that dumb. They have no class to handle these things intelligently. All my moneyed friends have sent their kids to the top universities, were they caught? People like Lori and Felicity with their stupidity bring shame to us moneyed people. Everyone will now think that we committed such stupid acts to send our kids to top universities. What can one expect from these Hollywood types? They do know how to mess it up for honest, hardworking, intelligent moneyed people like me. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
You want to send your kid to USC? Just donate some change. Do not bribe. Just donate. </p>
