Betsy DeVos, the US Secretary of Education, decided to cut fundings for programs run at schools in service of Special Olympics. DeVos has decided that these programs deviate students from what they should be doing day in and day out - studying math and science in schools so that students can work for corporations when they graduate. DeVos says that when philanthropic organisations are supporting Special Olympics why should the government put any money into it. This money is better spent in keeping students locked in schools.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7"> 
Department of Education currently budgets $17 Million on Special Olympics, and with this cut DeVos is reducing the country’s debt by a yuuuuuge 0.0001%. DeVos argues that the students are getting dumber and dumber, continuously lagging behind their peers in other countries in math and science scores. As the Secretary of Education, her mandate is to make every kid smart again so that her boss can keep the promise of ‘Make America Great Again’. </p>

When media blasted for stopping support to students with disabilities, DeVos stood her ground pointing that she is doing this to solve the menace of students losing interest in academics and wasting their time in sports. She was quick to point out that this is just a start. She is targeting not only Special Olympics but also all Olympics and all sports. Next in line are athletic programs and religious programs. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7"> 
It’s only apt to chain students to their desks and shove math and science down their heads. To ‘Make America Great Again’, DeVos is right to say that we need more Googles and Amazons, and we need more Brins, Pages, Pichais and Nadellas, and not Jordans, Lebrons, Serenas and Bradys. Only time will tell how far DeVos will be successful. After all, she has job for another 21 months, unless she gets fired by her boss soon for stealing the thunder of ‘Make America Great Again’. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7"> 
Corporations all across the US are very unhappy with the decision of DeVos, and are screaming in public that this is an attack on students with disabilities. DeVos is surprised that corporations have started caring about students and common Americans. Just this morning, she met a group of CEOs, who were asking to reduce minimum wage, reduce teacher salaries, reduce employer contributions to disability benefits and abolish unions so that CEOs can generate wealth for themselves and save their job from the clutches of the activist investors. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7"> 
DeVos is convinced that with her culling spending on Olympics, sports and religious programs, schools and students will be forced to focus on academics, study math and science, and become skilled in STEM. She believes that as more kids graduate with STEM degrees, corporations will no more get the opportunity to scream that there is shortage of local STEM workforce and hire cheap labor from other countries. DeVos is convinced that her move will alter the market dynamics in the US for generations to come and make American students more capable, the corporations are unhappy. She has decided that she will not change her policies, after she is answerable to her benevolent boss, who wants to ‘Make America Great Again’ at all costs, and this is the only way American can be made great again.</p>
