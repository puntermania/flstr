<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Claim adjudication is a process where a payer validates the submitted claim to determine whether to pay for procedures that provider has performed on patient. There are two possible outcomes of adjudication: approval and denial. 
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
If the claim is approved then determine how much the payer will pay to the provider and how much patient owes to the provider. If the claim is denied then provide an explanation for reasons for denial. If the claim is denied then after understanding the reasons of denial, the provider or the patient can make necessary corrections to submit the claim again. This claim will be treated as new claim, and it will have its own lifecycle. 
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
The flow of claim adjudication is below:

File Claim --> Initial Processing Review --> Automatic Review --> Manual Review --> Determine Payment --> Remit Payment
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Every claim adjudication goes through 4 steps before payment is remitted to provider and Explanation of Benefits (EOB) is sent to the patient. It is not necessary for a claim adjudication to go through all steps, the approval or denial can happen at any step depending on medical necessity and The claim can be denied at any step by the payer.
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Let’s look closely at what happens at each step. 


Initial processing review checks the claim for simple claims error or omissions. Following are some of the things looked at: 
1. Incorrect patient name 
2. Incorrect subscriber identification number
3. Incorrect insurance plan number
4. Incorrect service code
5. Patient’s gender doesn’t match the type of service claimed
6. Incorrect date of service
7. Incorrect procedure code
8. Patient’s gender or age doesn’t match the type of procedure
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
When a claim is rejected during the initial processing review, it can simply be corrected and resubmitted.
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Automatic review checks claim for items that are critical for the payer payment policies. Following are some of the things looked at:
1. Did patient have eligibility on the date of service?
2. Is pre-authorisation necessary for this service? If so, whether the pre-authorisation approval reference number is present? 
3. Is the service performed medically necessary?
4. Was pre-authorisation valid on the date of the service?
5. Is it the duplicate claim? i.e. was the claim already submitted for the same date or same procedure?
6. Has the claim filing deadline passed? 
7. Is the procedure code valid?
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
There are times when a claim can be sent to payer-authorised nurse or medical officer for manual medical review. The claim for manual review is sent to desk of nurse or medical officer electronically. The claim is then reviewed along with prior claims of the patient to determine the medical necessity and aptness of the procedure for the case in the claim. At this stage, additional health information such as charts, lab test results, X-Rays and other medical information may be requested from the patient or provider to further validate the medical necessity of the procedure. The nurse or the medical office at this stage can approve or deny the claim. Further, the nurse or medical officer can send the claim to a payer-authorised medical expert for their take on the necessity of the procedure. The decision by medical expert to approve or deny the claim is final. The manual review is more common for uncommon or unlisted procedures, or procedures for which provider bills very high.
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
Payment determination is the final stage of claim adjudication where a decision is made on whether to approve or deny the claim. If approved then a decision is made on whether to pay in full, as claimed by provider, or pay a reduced amount. If the claim is denied then the reason for denial is elaborated in the communication to be sent to the provider and the patient. It is not uncommon to have a claim approved at a reduced amount. This happens when a service is billed too high. Based on the information presented, the procedure code can be downgraded to a lower level by the payer, and in that case claim is approved at a reduced amount, and the patient is billed for remaining. 

During the remit payment, which is done after claim adjudication, Electronic Remittance Advice File is sent to the provider. Following information is sent to the provider:
1. Allowed amount
2. Covered amount
3. Approved amount
4. Amount paid to payer
5. Amount to be billed to patient
6. Discount amount
7. Adjudication date
</p> <br />

<p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7">
After the claim has been adjudicated, the claim is closed with its lifecycle coming to an end. The claim adjudication takes anywhere from 5 days to a few weeks.
